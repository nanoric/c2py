future plan:
    * hint for wrapped c function pointer
    cxx_analysis:
        * namespaces
    generator:
        * names for typedefs(complicated, maybe extra .py file is necessary)
        * add lint comment for hint if there is one

not supported:
    * namespace is currently not supported
    * c++11 strong typed enums(treat as traditional enum)
    * default arguments are not supported
    * all of union
    * std::unique_ptr and so on(seems unsupported by libclang)

hacks:
    * treat any virtual function as callback
    * if argument for a callback is pointer or reference, its value will be copied, modifying its value will have no effect
    * c_function_pointer with void * -> std::function without void *(no hint currently)
